# Image-Deepfake-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning

This project leverages deep learning and transfer learning techniques to classify deepfake images.
Multiple pre-trained models were used and compared, including:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
2. ResNet50
3. EfficientNetB0
4. Xception
5. MesoNet

# 🛠️Tech Stack
1. Python
2. TensorFlow / Keras
3. Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
4. NumPy / Pandas

# 📦Installation
